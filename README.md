# MasterThesis_DigitRecognition_Processing-Java
This master thesis introduces an approach to digit recognition based on the
Histogram of Oriented Gradients method and cosine similarity. The work
describes a prototype system that implements the introduced approach and
illustrates it for the case of car license plate digit recognition. The recognition
accuracy is 93%.
