# An Approach to Digit Recognition
Based on Histogram of Oriented
Gradients
This master thesis introduces an approach to digit recognition based on the
Histogram of Oriented Gradients method and cosine similarity. The work
describes a prototype system that implements the introduced approach and
illustrates it for the case of car license plate digit recognition. The recognition
accuracy is 93%.
